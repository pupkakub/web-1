                Naughty Dog is an American company known as one of 
                the leading video game developers in the world. 
                Founded in 1984 by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin,
                it originally produced small projects for various platforms. 
                However, the real breakthrough occurred in the mid-90s, 
                when the studio began to cooperate with Sony. 
                The company's most famous games include such legendary series 
                as Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation, 
                Jak and Daxter for the PlayStation 2, 
                as well as Uncharted and The Last of Us for later generations 
                of consoles.

                With a focus on cinematic style, deep plots and thoughtful design,
                Naughty Dog has gained recognition as a studio that can combine 
                technical perfection with emotional, touching stories. 
                In particular, the series Uncharted and The Last of Us 
                received many awards and became the standard of quality 
                in the industry. The studio remains part of PlayStation 
                Studios and continues to set the standard in creating 
                high-budget, plot-oriented games.
