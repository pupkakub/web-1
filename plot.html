                    Events unfold in a post-apocalyptic world, 
                    where humanity is almost exterminated 
                    by a fungal infection of cordyceps,
                    which turns people into aggressive mutants. 
                    The protagonist Joel, who lost his daughter at the very beginning of the epidemic, 
                    lives in a quarantine zone and is smuggling. 
                    His task is to deliver a 14-year-old girl, Ellie,
                    who turns out to be immune to infection, through 
                    the dangerous ruins of America to the Cicada resistance group, 
                    which plans to use her to create a vaccine. 
                    Throughout the journey, Joel and Ellie overcome many difficulties: 
                    mutants, armed bandits, treacherous survivors, 
                    as well as their own inner experiences. 
                    Their relationship grows deeper, and Joel begins to see Ella as his dead daughter.
                    At the end of the season, when the Cicadas report that Ellie must die to create a vaccine, 
                    Joel makes a painful decision - he saves her, 
                    killing many people in the process. 
                    He decides that Ellie's life is more important than the possible salvation 
                    of humanity, hiding from her the truth about what happened.

                    The plot of the second part unfolds in a few years. 
                    Ellie lives in the settlement of Jackson with her friend Dina,
                    trying to forget the horrors of the past. 
                    However, their peace is shattered when their lives are affected 
                    by a violent attack by a group of strangers led by 
                    a young woman named Abby, who harbors a personal 
                    hatred of Joel. After the tragic loss of an important 
                    person for her, Ellie embarks on a journey of revenge, 
                    overcome by rage and pain. She gradually loses herself 
                    in the pursuit of revenge, facing moral challenges 
                    that question her humanity. This season explores themes of hate, 
                    retribution and forgiveness, 
                    showing how destructive a thirst for revenge can be.
