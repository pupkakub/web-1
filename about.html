                    The Last of Us is a video game series developed by Naughty Dog, consisting of two main parts: The Last of Us (2013) and The Last of Us Part II (2020). 
                    These are adventure action games with survival elements set in a post-apocalyptic world, where civilization was destroyed by an outbreak of the Cordyceps fungus, 
                    which turns people into aggressive infected.
                
                    In the world of The Last of Us, the Cordyceps fungus infects the human brain, taking control of the body and completely altering behavior. 
                    The infected become violent and lose human consciousness, transforming into dangerous creatures that attack others. 
                    The infection spreads either through fungal spores or by the bite of an infected person.
                
                    The games combine intense action, stealth mechanics, an emotional story, and multi-layered characters, creating a deeply immersive experience.
